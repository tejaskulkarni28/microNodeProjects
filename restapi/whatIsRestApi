Rest api is a set of principles which follows client-server architecture. It has Post, Get, Patch, Delete methods which have certain meaning for each of the methods. Get means getting the data, post means adding the data, patch means updating the data, delete means deleting the data. Let's say we are sending the html response to the client and our client browser but what if client is android, amazon alexa like a smart device. Then how a html document response will be rendered on the client side. Therefore rest api tells us to follow json formating as a response to the client.
